# Safe and Sound
Safe and Sound offers automatic image background control during videocalls. In case of dynamic image disturbance such as cohabitants passed by in the background, Safe and Sound blurs it to reduce the anxiety of embarrassing situations for a speaker.
# Inspiration
With more people than ever working from home, there are going to be some screwups causing anxiety. For example, the Web is full of stories about people who experienced embarrassing situations where partners passed by in the background wearing only underwear or children by accident entered the room. As, for instance, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY). If you are having an important meeting, it is not always possible to find a totally secluded place. So it would be helpful, if technology could help to escape such a situation at the very last moment.
# What it does
Safe and Sound automatically adds blur to the background in the video when a dynamic object becomes a part of it.
# How we built it
To detect dynamic objects and blur to the background, the OpenCV library is used.
